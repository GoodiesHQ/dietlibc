LIBPTHREAD

  This is the pthread implementation of dietlibc.
  Written from scratch by Olaf Dreesen.


STATUS: incomplete / may work or not


It's like linuxthreads a clone base thread implementation.


There is no separate "Manager Thread" or whatever.
Each thread is generated straight forward, no pipes no pain....

hope that nested threads are working fine... (not yet tested)


NON STANDARD SIGNAL HANDLING:

  SIGHUP	the targeted thread is canceled
	depends on the cancel type of the thread.

	ASYNCHRONOUS: the signal handler will KILL the thread immediately.

	DEFERRED: the signal handler make its thread as canceled.
		(only for the sig-handler to do some sane stuff...)

  SIGTERM	the thread is KILLED
	if the thread signaled is the main thread, then ALL child-threads
	will get a SIGHUP and after some micros a SIGTERM....

  SIGCHLD	a thread has exited
	if a child-thread exited then this handler is started to free the
	thread-struct for reuse
