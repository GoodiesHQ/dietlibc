I have implemented the "Manager Thread" so that nested thread creation
works. really ugly stuff... don't look at it unless you're sitting on solid

first of all:
  I strongly suggest NOT to use it yet, it's very, very, ... very

  incomplete functions and unusable states....

  I'm still working on the final alpha...
